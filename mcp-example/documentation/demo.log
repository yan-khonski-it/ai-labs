 Based on the provided code, here's how the `getConnection()` method internally works within the `HikariPool` class:

 1.  **Timeout Handling:**
     *   It first sets the `connectionTimeout` and `validationTimeout` based on the configuration.
     *   If a connection isn't available within the `connectionTimeout`, it creates a `SQLTransientConnectionException` (wrapped with the original exception) and throws it.

 2.  **Waiting for Connections:**
     *   It attempts to get a connection from the `connectionBag` (which likely holds waiting connections).

 3.  **Housekeeping Loop:**
     *   If no connection is immediately available, the `HouseKeeper` thread periodically runs.  During this loop, the housekeeper checks if any connections have exceeded their `idleTimeout`.  If so, it attempts to soft-evict those connections.

 4.  **Creating a New Connection (if needed):**
     *   If connections are still unavailable after the housekeeping loop, the `getConnection()` method triggers the creation of a new connection using the `createPoolEntry()` method. This involves establishing a new connection from the database driver.

 In essence, the `getConnection()` method first attempts to retrieve an existing connection, then creates a new connection if none are available. It uses a housekeeper thread to manage and retire connections that have exceeded their timeouts.

 Based on the provided code, here’s how metrics are collected and the relevant classes:

 **Metrics Collection:**

 The code uses the `HikariConnectionProvider` which provides a connection provider for Hibernate.  This provider is responsible for obtaining and managing database connections. It also provides a way to track metrics related to these connections.

 **Relevant Classes:**

 *   **`HikariConnectionProvider`**: This class is central to the metric collection. It manages the `HikariDataSource` and provides the `getConnection()` method, which is how connections are obtained.  It also handles closing connections.
 *   **`HikariDataSource`**: This is the core HikariCP component. It's responsible for managing the underlying database connections and, crucially, provides a `getConnection()` method that is used to obtain connection objects.
 *   **`HikariConfigurationUtil`**: This class is responsible for loading the HikariCP configuration from Hibernate properties, which includes settings that affect connection pooling and behavior.
 *   **`HikariConfig`**: This class represents the configuration for HikariCP.

 **In summary, the primary mechanism for collecting metrics is through the `HikariDataSource`’s connection management and the `HikariConnectionProvider`’s use of it.**
